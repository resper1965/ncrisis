# PIIDetector Security Audit Report

> **Test Files Notice**
> This repository includes `virus_test.zip` and `infected_test.zip` for antivirus detection tests. These archives only contain mock virus strings and are safe.
## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### 1. Express.js Version Update
- **Issue**: Express 4.19.2 had known vulnerabilities
- **Fix**: Updated to Express 4.21.2 (latest stable)
- **Impact**: Fixes multiple security issues including path traversal and DoS vulnerabilities

### 2. ClamAV Service Security Hardening
- **Issue**: Potential command injection in ClamAV integration
- **Fix**: Implemented secure ClamAV service with:
  - Input validation and path sanitization
  - Command argument sanitization
  - Process timeout controls
  - Error handling improvements
  - File size limits

### 3. Environment Configuration Security
- **Issue**: Weak example secrets in .env.example
- **Fix**: Replaced with secure placeholders and generation instructions
- **Impact**: Prevents accidental use of weak credentials in production

### 4. Docker Security Improvements
- **Issue**: Missing security updates in containers
- **Fix**: Added `npm audit fix --force` to Dockerfiles
- **Impact**: Ensures containers have latest security patches

## Security Measures Implemented

### Input Validation
- Path traversal prevention in file operations
- MIME type validation with sanitization
- File extension validation
- File size limits enforcement

### Process Security
- Timeout controls for external processes
- Safe process spawning with argument validation
- Error handling to prevent information disclosure
- Resource limits to prevent DoS

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal attack surface with Alpine Linux
- Security headers in Nginx configuration
- Network isolation with Docker networks

### Data Protection
- Secure random secret generation
- Database connection encryption ready
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- HTTPS enforcement in production

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Implement automated dependency updates
2. **Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning in CI/CD
3. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
